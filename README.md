# ODH AI Edge Use Cases

Artifacts in support of ODH Edge use cases that integration with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management(Open Cluster Management)

| Components                           | Version |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
| OpenShift                            | 4.13    |
| Open Data Hub                        | 2.x     |
| Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management  | 2.8     |
| OpenShift Pipelines                  | 1.11.x  |
| Quay Registry                        | 2.8     |

## Proof of Concept Edge use case with ACM

The main objective is to showcase that a user can take a trained model, use a pipeline to package it with all the dependencies and deploy it at the near edge location(s) in a centralized way.

### Infrastructure Configuration

1. Provision OpenShift Cluster
1. Configure the default Identity Provider
1. Install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
   1. Install Advanced Cluster Management from OperatorHub
   1. Create a ACM MultiClusterHub object using the defaults
   1. Create the ACM Provider Credentials to provision and manage infrastructures
1. Register the clusters
[ACM Application](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html/applications/managing-applications) manifests are located in [acm/registration](acm/registration) to register and configure the target environments required for the AI at the Edge use cases.  The files can be applied to the ACM hub cluster manually:
   ```
   $  oc apply -k acm/registration
   ```
   * Core - Cluster host the ODH Core components that will be used in the MLOps Engineer workflow to train, build and push the model.  This cluster is not required to be co-located with the ACM Hub but we group them together to simplify the use case
   * Near Edge - Cluster(s) that will host the running model at the edge.  This is the target environment after a new model is available for use
1. Deploy Open Data Hub to the Core cluster and register any configurations to support pushing models to the edge cluster
   * GitOps repos
   * Image repos
1. Manage the edge cluster environments to support deployment of models and support for monitoring
   * Configure ACM Observability
   * Deploy the Model container

### MLOps Engineer workflows

1. Develop the model in an ODH Jupyter notebook
1. Build the model from the notebook using Data Science Pipelines
1. Push the model to the image registry accessible by the near edge cluster(s)
1. Update the GitOps config for the near edge cluster

### Pipelines setup

See [pipelines/README.md](pipelines/README.md)

### Observability setup

* Edge cluster(s)
  * Login to edge cluster
  * Enable userWorkloadMonitoring
    * `oc edit cm cluster-monitoring-config`
    * Set variable `enableUserWorkload` to `true`
  * Edit contents of [thanos-secret](acm/odh-core/acm-observability/secrets/thanos.yaml) file.
